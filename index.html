    <div class="card-header">Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
            The name of my modified artifact is Appointment System app. This is a web-based app written in Java backend and Angular Frontend. I will be using Groovy language in the backend along with Spring framework and angular in the frontend. Groovy is a language built on top of Java. It is concise and clearer than Java when it comes to syntax.
            Software engineering/designing is about creating a strong foundation of a project that rest of the implementation will rest upon. When building a house, a strong foundation is necessary to support all the loads and structure that makes the house look nicer from outside. Similarly, software engineering is about creating a uniform code structure/layer where the rest of the component follow very similar pattern. The open-source project that I picked for my artifact give me the strong engineering foundation which uses existing pattern called MVC design pattern.
            MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern will help me structure code in such a way that anytime a code needs a modification in specific areas, it is easy to go to that package and make a modification. Model represents the domain object that an application need. View is the presentation layer of the application. Essentially what the user will see in the browser. Controller is responsible for fetching model from database and sending that information back to the view.

    <div class="card-header">Enhancement 2: Data structure and Algorithm</div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
            Data structure and algorithm is about using appropriate kind of data to store the information. There are two most important data structure. These are list, set, and map. List stores the many similar items in a collection. Map stores the key, value pair and finally set store unique information i.e. it prevents duplicate data. In my artifact I have extensively use these data type.
            In my appointment system app, one of the requirements is to fetch all the appointment related to a user form the business. To fulfil this requirement, I used list to fetch all the data from the database. Similarly, I used map to return the http status back to user. Sometime the request sent by frontend may not be valid or perhaps user tried to get details on an appointment that does not exist. In this case I used map to return data back to client where the key is the name of the error and the value inside map contains specific information such as invalid appointment, invalid user and so on.
            Algorithm is about writing steps to accomplish an specific task. I have utilized algorithm in almost all areas however I will talk about one concreate example. User can sign up on this appointment system app. In fact, they have to have an account to create an appointment. The signup algorithm I wrote work like this:
            <li>1)	Is the user duplicate? i.e. same username exist in db? If so, display error</li>
            <li>  2)	Does the user have all the information like first name, last name, date of birth, password, confirm password?</li>
            If all of the above is true then the code will call another service called userService.save method to save the user with default role of user.

    <div class="card-header">Enhancement 3: Databases</div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
            Databases plays very important role in computer science or app development. It is the de-factor storage mechanism for persisting data over the network or in long term. In my enhancement three, I will be talking about my usage of database in my appointment system app. The name of the database is called appointment_system for my use cases. I have three tables that stores various information required for appointment app.
            In Databases, table stores information in rows and columns. I have role, user, and user_roles, and appointment tables. The design of tables is done is such a way that it is easy to retrieve and store relative information related to the actor of the applications. For example, user information is stored in user table. Appointment information is stored in appointment table. Users_roles stores the many-to-many user and role information. Many users can be in many roles. Converse is true as well. Many roles can be associated with many users.

        <h5>Software design and engineering</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
            I used software engineering principle on this enhancement because it uses one of the design patterns that I learned in one of my CS classes. While modifying it, I realized that the code was done in such a way that it was easy to refactor. For example, I tried to move the code based on the package. Controllers live in controller package. Entities live in entity package. Minor tweak was needed to create such changes.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h5>Algorithms and Data Structure</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
            As I was learning to modify the existing enhancement, I realized that sometimes we tend to over think on how to accomplish a particular thing. I initially struggle with implementing the rest stateless authentication system. However, after doing some research it looks like I can use java filter to intercept every request and check if the particular request has a authentication token generated by the application in the prior request. If this is a case then the header has a valid token, I can assume the user as authenticated not otherwise.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h5>Database</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
            For this enhancement, the initial process was little difficult because I had to connect MySQL with JPA. The ORM mapping was bit tricky, and I had to learn little bit of Java Persistence API. JPA is a bridge that connects SQL to the world of Java. It is essentially and ORM mapping tools. It helps map object to the database row and column. Once I learned above, the rest of the integration went on very smoothly.

            In my opinion, this capstone project was a great artifact. I can add this to my portfolio in GitHub. It will act a showcase tool for future employer. If a company wants to interview me for a job, they can check my work in GitHub. They will be able to see the sample of my work.
            The capstone covered all the major areas that employers look for when hiring a new people. These key areas are software design, data structure and its utilization, and database. Because I have used all three it these capstones in a single artifact, it provides me a holistic experience if I were to implement something from the scratch. In essence, this capstone project has helped me reviewed my previous work and refresh my memory of multiple skills which will be a key in finding a new job.
